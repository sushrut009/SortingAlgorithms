Mergesort is a very popular sorting algorithm. The worst case time complexity of this algorithm is O(nlogn) . 
It is much better than a few other simpler sorting algorithms like insertion sort , selection sort and bubble 
sort. 

Disadvantages :
One of the disadvantages of merge sort is that it needs another array in memory which is equal in size to the 
array being sorted . So ,in place sorting is not possible with merge sort.
